# NOT YET FINISHED !!!
# WiFiManager for Multidisplay
This is a custom fork of the development branch of tzapu's [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/tree/development) especially created for [Tobers Multidisplay](https://github.com/ElToberino/Tobers_Multidisplay). It works with ESP8266 and ESP32.

The changes I made are mainly visual ones: some new/other css rules and some changes in shown menu items:
